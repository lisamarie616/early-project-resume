    	<p>"For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?' And whenever the answer has been 'No' for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something." - Steve Jobs</p>
    	<p>“One must never be either content with, or impatient with, oneself.” - C.S. Lewis</p>
    	<p>“A sheltered life can be a daring life as well. For all serious daring starts from within.” - Eudora Welty</p>
    	<p>“He knew that under the tall grass of an apparently untamed future the steel rails of fear and habit were already laid. What he suddenly couldn’t bear, with every cell in his body, was to act out the destiny prepared for him by his past, and slide obediently along those rails, contemplating bitterly all the routes he would rather have taken.” - Edward St. Aubyn</p>
    	<p>“Slumbering in every human being lies an infinity of possibilities, which one must not arouse in vain. For it is terrible when the whole man resonates with echoes and echoes, none becoming a real voice.” - Elias Canetti</p>

    	<h1>Coding</h1>
    	<p>Most of my career has been spent in accounting, which has never excited me. I recall one day a couple of years ago when I wondered what made me happiest in my work. I loved the Excel formulas--the more complicated the better. I loved writing them. I loved when they worked. I loved when they did something extremely useful. At that point, I had been curious about coding for awhile and began to dabble in things like Codeacademy and Udemy courses. I was instantly hooked. Coding was like writing Excel formulas, but better. There was more depth, more to learn, and even more useful things to create. I have continued my learning online and attended in person coding events. And, I have loved every minute of it.</p>

    	<h1>Places</h1>
    	<p>Some of my favorite places in the world are Belvedere Castle in Central Park, Magens Bay in Saint Thomas, and Paso Robles in California. I want to go everywhere and see everything. Someday soon I hope to travel to Whitehaven Beach in Queensland, Australia.</p>

    	<h1>Music</h1>
    	<p>I don't know what I would do without music in my life. I listen to music every day and I enjoy discovering new artists and songs. Some of the bands I love at the moment are Phantogram, The Naked and Famous, Foster the People, Twin Shadow, The xx, B0RNS, Electric Guest, St. Lucia, The 1975, Passion Pit, Of Monsters and Men, A Silent Film, Two Door Cinema Club, White Sea, MisterWives, The Last Royals, The Kite String Tangle, Jack Garratt, and Glass Animals. Weezer will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>
